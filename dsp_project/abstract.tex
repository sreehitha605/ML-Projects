      Agriculture plays a crucial role in Indian economy and employment. Half of the country's population is still employed on agriculture sector. India is one of the largest producers of agricultural products, but still it has less farm production. The most common problem faced by the farmers is that they do not opt the crop based on the necessity of soil. This problem can be solved by using crop recommendation system.\par
A crop recommendation system is a project that helps the farmers to enhance their crop production by recommending the best crops based on soil properties. This system uses machine learning algorithms to analyse the data collected from several sources. Based on this analysis,the system can  suggest the best crop to grow in a particular area,by taking the factors such as soil type,temperature,rainfall etc. It helps to improve crop yields and reduce waste. It helps the farmers to save time and money in reducing the non suitable crop selection. It also helps the farmers to take better decisions for farming.\par
This system helps to implement the crop selection method so that this method helps in solving many agriculture and farmers problems. This improves our Indian economy by maximizing the yield rate of crop production.
