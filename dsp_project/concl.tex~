	This thesis presented a  method for binarization of grayscale documents which are degraded under uneven lighting condtions and elimination of color halftones from printed color documents with text extraction by graphics elimination. For colored images, the binarization is done using otsu algorithm after eliminating color halftones. The novel contribution of this work is extraction of reversed text regions and elimination of color halftones using Butterworth band reject filter, text extraction and graphics elimination. Text extraction based on a statistical analysis of the heights of the connected components. Our results show that, Butterworth bandreject filter can eliminate color halftones in the documents. Since all newspapers does not use same printing technology, parameters (length of major and minor axis of ellipse) in dither removal depends on type of Newspaper. We worked on different telugu newspapers, each having different values say Sakshi-0.64, Eenadu-0.66, Andhrajyothy-0.71, where each value denotes percent of the  size of the major and minor axis with image dimension. As far as text extraction is concerned our results show that the heights of the text components lies in the range of 4 to 60 pixels for documents scanned at 300 dpi with text in the font sizes of 12-18 points. These results over 50 colored images show that the preprocessing improves over the existing preprocessing techniques.
